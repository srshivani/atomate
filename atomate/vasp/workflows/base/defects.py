    Returns a charged defect workflow

    Firework 0 : (optional) relaxation of the given bulk structure before running rest of workflow
    Firework 1 : (optional) run hybrid calculation of bulk structure to allow for band edge realignment
                            with respect to hybrid band edges.
    Firework 2 : (optional) dielectric calculation
    Firework 3 : DefectSetupFiretask for setting up all bulk and defect supercell calculations
    Firework 4 : bulk supercell calculation
    Firework 5 - len(defectcalcs): Optimize the internal structure (fixed volume)
                                   of each charge+defect combination.

    Args:
        structure (Structure): input structure to have defects run on
        name (str): some appropriate name for the workflow.
        user_incar_settings (dict):
            a dictionary of incar settings specified by user for both bulk and defect supercells
        vasp_cmd (str): Command to run vasp.
        db_file (str): path to file containing the database credentials.
        conventional (bool): flag to use conventional structure (rather than primitive) for defect supercells,
            defaults to True.
        diel_flag (bool): flag to also run dielectric calculations.
            (required for charge corrections to be run) defaults to True.
        n_max (int): maximum supercell size to consider for supercells

        vacancies (list):
            If list is totally empty, all vacancies are considered (default).
            If only specific vacancies are desired then add desired Element symbol to the list
                ex. ['Ga'] in GaAs structure will only produce Galium vacancies

            if NO vacancies are desired, then just add an empty list to the list
                ex. [ [] ]  yields no vacancies

        substitutions (dict):
            If dict is totally empty, all intrinsic antisites are considered (default).
            If only specific antisites/substituions are desired then add vacant site type as key, with list of
                sub site symbol as value
                    ex 1. {'Ga': ['As'] } in GaAs structure will only produce Arsenic_on_Gallium antisites
                    ex 2. {'Ga': ['Sb'] } in GaAs structure will only produce Antimonide_on_Gallium substitutions

            if NO antisites or substitutions are desired, then just add an empty dict
                ex. {'None':{}}  yields no antisites or subs


        interstitials (list):
            If list is totally empty, NO interstitial defects are considered (default).
            Option 1 for generation: If one wants to use Pymatgen to predict interstitial
                    then list of pairs of [symbol, generation method (str)] can be provided
                        ex. ['Ga', 'Voronoi'] in GaAs structure will produce Galium interstitials from the
                            Voronoi site finding algorithm
                        NOTE: only options for interstitial generation are "Voronoi" and "Nils"
            Option 2 for generation: If user wants to add their own interstitial sites for consideration
                    the list of pairs of [symbol, Interstitial object] can be provided, where the
                    Interstitial pymatgen.analysis.defects.core object is used to describe the defect of interest


        initial_charges (dict):
            says how to specify initial charges for each defect.
            An empty dict (DEFAULT) is to do a fairly restrictive charge generation method:
                for vacancies: use bond valence method to assign oxidation states and consider
                    negative of the vacant site's oxidation state as single charge to try
                antisites and subs: use bond valence method to assign oxidation states and consider
                    negative of the vacant site's oxidation state as single charge to try +
                    added to likely charge of substitutional site (closest to zero)
                interstitial: charge zero
            For non empty dict, charges are specified as:
                initial_charges = {'vacancies': {'Ga': [-3,2,1,0]},
                                   'substitutions': {'Ga': {'As': [0]} },
                                   'interstitials': {}}
                in the GaAs structure this makes vacancy charges in states -3,-2,-1,0; Ga_As antisites in the q=0 state,
                and all other defects will have charges generated in the restrictive automated format stated for DEFAULT

        rerelax_flag (bool):
            Flag to re-relax the input structure for minimizing forces 
            (does volume relaxation of small primitive cell) 
            Default is False (no re-relaxation occurs)
        hybrid_run_for_gap_corr (bool):
            Flag to run a single small hybrid bulk structure for band edge shifting correction.
            Default is True (Hybrid will be calculated)
        user_kpoints_settings (dict or Kpoints pmg object):
            a dictionary of kpoint settings specific by user OR an Actual Kpoint set to be used for the supercell calculations
